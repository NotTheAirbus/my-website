    <p>Welp, looks like you have found an error, the site you were looking for isn't available at the time or doesn't exist, or you hit the "Go to the Error 404" Page on the main page.
      <br>
      You can try checking the URL? If this website is broken (if the https://actual.gr.neocities.org site is broken and redirects you to this one) shoot me an email at NotA318@proton.me, please</p>
